# Report Artifacts

`analysis/analyze.py` writes the main report bundle here:

- `findings.md`
- `paper.md`
- `blog_post.md`
- `executive_summary.md`
- `social_thread.md`
- `data_card.md`
- `charts/condition_summary_latest.csv`

The initial scaffold keeps this file in git; generated artifacts are produced after first run.
